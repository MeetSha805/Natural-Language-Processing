The field of AI research was founded on the claim that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\". This raised philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity.\n",
